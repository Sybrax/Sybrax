## About me
A random ``javascript developer``, but with the merit of being enthusiastic, passionate and reasonable, and with energy to spare. HiðŸ‘‹. I'm Lohan, a french developer and right now all I'm waiting for is you!

## Skills

Experienced ``javascript`` developer for 4 years now. Using :

+ ReactJS, ViteJS, NextJS, VanillaJS, NodeJS, ExpressJS.

> A lot of things ending in JS probably.

And of course, since js isn't everything, ``TailwindCSS`` completes the picture.

**Are you looking for an available developer? We'll find it.**
```js
const getADev(type) => {
  return developers.filter(dev => dev.type === type);
}
console.log(getADev('javascript')) // Oh... it's Lohan ðŸ¤™
```
