## About me
A random ``javascript developer``, but with the merit of being enthusiastic, passionate and reasonable, and with energy to spare. HiðŸ‘‹. I'm Lohan, and right now all I'm waiting for is you!

## Skills

Experienced ``javascript`` developer for 4 years now. Using :

+ ReactJS, ViteJS, NextJS, VanillaJS, NodeJS, ExpressJS.

A lot of things ending in JS probably.

And of course, since js isn't everything, ``TailwindCSS`` completes the picture.
